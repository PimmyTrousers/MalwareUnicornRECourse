## Section 4.0: Triage Analysis

- You will want to quickly narrow down specific infomration and indicators before moving on to deeper static and dynamic analysis.
- Basic checklist to complete for every new analysis:
  - File contents and delivery
  - file information and header analysis
  - get basic PE information
  - Simple search
  - Collect strings
  - Check AV vendors
  - Quick VM Detonation
  - Captrue network information

### File Context and Delivery:
  - Its important to ask how the malware got there in the first place
  - Questions to ask yourself:
    - Did it come from an email?
    - Did it come from a browser download?
    - Was it quarantined in an Anti-Virus?
    - Is it an anomalous process running?


### File Information & Header Analysis:
  - Use the 'file' command to determine the filetype
  - Verify the file header using a hex editor

### Get Basic PE Information:
  - Parse the PE header using the tool CFF Explorer
  - Determine what resources, DLL imports and libraries are used
    - For example if you see Ws2_32.dll it might be setting up a network connection because its used for setting up sockets

### Simple search
  - Calculate the hash of the file and check the web to see if its been seen already

### Collect strings
  - Using the string command in linux or BinText tool, extract the strings to find any clues

### Check AV
  - Run the file against an Anti-Virus or VirusTotal to see if there are any detections

### Quick VM Detonation
  - Use open source VM Detonation services like hybrid-analysis.com or malwr.com to get the behavior quickly

### Capture network information
  - Use the VM detonation service to capture any netowkr connections or packet data
  - If you can't do this thne we will need to dynamically debug the malware
