## Section 2.1: Malware Techniques

### Techniques Overview:

  - Compression
  - Obfuscation
  - Persistence
  - Privilege Escalation
  - Defense Evasion
  - Credential Theft
  - Reconnaissance
  - Lateral Movement
  - Execution
  - Collection
  - Exfiltration
  - Command and Control

#### Compression

  - Combinign the compressed data with decompression code into a single executable
  - Runtime packers
  - Self Extracting archives
  - List of packers
    - Themida
    - Armadillo
    - ASPack
    - ASPR (ASProtect)
    - BoxedApp Packer
    - CExe
    - dotBundle
    - Enigma Protector
    - EXE Bundle
    - EXE Stealth
    - eXPressor
    - FSG
    - kkrunchy
    - MEW
    - MPRESS
    - Obsidium
    - PESpin
    - Petite
    - RLPack Basic
    - Smart Packer ProgramThemida
    - UPX
    - VMProtect
    - XComp/XPack

#### Obfuscation

  - Deliberate act of creating obfuscated code that is difficult for humans to understand
  - Plain text strings will appear as base64 or Xor
  - Malicious behavior will include junk function or routines hat do nothing to throw off a reverser.
    - Control-Flow Flattening
    - String Enryption

#### Persistence

  - Once malware gains access to a system, it often looks to be there for a long time
  - If the persistence mechanims is unique eough, it can even serve as a great way to idetnify a given piece of Malware

#### Privilege Escalation

  - Exploiting a bug, design flaw or configuration oversight in an operating system or software application to gain elevated access to resources that are normally protected from an application or user
  - Common Techniques:
    - Dll search order hijacking
    - Dll injection
    - Exploiting a vulnerability
      - Buffer Overflow
      - Stack Overflow
      - heapspray
      - Return Oriented Programming
    - Credential Theft
    - UAC Bypass

#### Defense Evasion

  - Evading detection or avoiding defenses
  - Common Techniques:
    - Killing AV
    - Deleting itself after a run
    - Timebombs/Timestomping
    - Stolen Certificates
    - Dll Side Loading
    - Masquerading
    - Process Hallowing
    - Code Inejction

#### Credential Theft

  - Going after password storage
  - keylogging passwords
  - screenshots

#### Reconnaissance

  - gain Knowledge about the system and internal network

#### Lateral Movement

  - Enable an adversary to access and control remote systems on the network

#### Execution

  - Techniques that result in exectuion of adversay controlled code on a local or remote system
  - scripts
  - post-exploitation

#### Collection

  - Identify and gather information such as sensitive files from a target network prior to exfiltration

#### Exfiltration

  - Removing files and information

#### Command and Control

  - Communicate with systems under their control
